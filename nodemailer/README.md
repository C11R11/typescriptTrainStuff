It would help if you generated an app password to use nodemailer.

First, you need to turn on two-factor-authentication.
And then in your manage account go to security.
You can see the app password below two-step verification.
Go to app password select app other and write custom app name (example project name) and click on generate.
You get a password use that password instead of your mail password.

> Note: I created a pass named "Nodemailer"
